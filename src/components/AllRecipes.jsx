      <p className='text-center'>Welcome to our recipes page! We know that finding the perfect recipe can be a challenge, 
        which is why we've designed our recipe layout with you in mind. Our sophisticated layout 
        combines the best of both worlds - a grid view layout for easy browsing, and a single-page
         layout for all the details you need for each recipe. Our grid view layout showcases a 
         variety of recipes with thumbnail images that make it easy to find what you're looking 
         for. When you click on a recipe, you'll be taken to a single page that provides all the
          information you need, including ingredients, instructions, and photos. We've also
           included a section for related recipes, so you can easily find other recipes that 
           are similar to the one you're viewing. We hope you enjoy our recipes and our 
           easy-to-use layout. Whether you're an experienced chef or just starting out,
            we're confident you'll find a recipe that's perfect for you on our website.
